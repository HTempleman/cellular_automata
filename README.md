# cellular_automata

The above file is a cellular automata simulation inspired by Conways Game of Life. Based upon a set of initial conditions, 
namely the placement of cells and the rules guiding how they might interact, a chain reaction unfolds that resembles the 
emergent complexity that John Conway found so interesting in conceiving this little game. 

As the extension suggests, this file is meant to be run in Mathematica.
